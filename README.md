#  Inventory Management System (IMS) – System Design Project

This project presents a **comprehensive system design** for a Warehouse Inventory Management System (IMS), focused on object-oriented principles, UML modeling, and frontend UI prototyping. It was developed as part of a system design coursework or capstone using industry-standard tools and methodologies.

---

##  Project Objective

To design a scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly inventory management system that enables warehouse staff and administrators to:

- Track products and stock levels
- Manage categories, suppliers, and warehouse locations
- Monitor stock status (e.g., low inventory)
- Plan for future system implementation using Agile methodology

---

##  Features (Design Scope Only)

- Role-based access (Admin, Staff)
- Product and category management
- Inventory updates and alerts
- Supplier management
- Dashboard overview
- Responsive UI mockups (Figma)

---

##  Tools & Technologies

| Tool/Tech     | Purpose                            |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| **UML**       | System modeling (Use Case, Class, etc.) |
| **OOAD**      | Object-oriented analysis & design principles |
| **Figma**     | UI/UX wireframing and prototyping |
| **Agile/Scrum** | Project planning and sprint management |
| **Draw.io / Lucidchart** | Diagram creation (if not using code tools) |

---

##  System Architecture

Follows a **3-tier layered architecture**:

1. **Presentation Layer**
   - Figma UI mockups (Login, Dashboard, Product Management)
2. **Business Logic Layer**
   - Inventory rules, validations, user roles
3. **Data Access Layer**
   - Abstracted interfaces for inventory data storage (design only)

---

## 📐 UML Diagrams

-  Use Case Diagram
-  Class Diagram
-  Sequence Diagram
-  Activity Diagram
- (Optional) State Diagram

All diagrams follow proper OOAD conventions and model core system behaviors and interactions.

---

##  Agile Workflow

- Sprint Planning: 3 weekly sprints
- Artifacts: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog
-  Roles: Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team
-  Burn-down charts for progress tracking (optional)

---

##  Testing Strategy (Design-Level)

Though the system is not implemented, a testing strategy has been proposed:

- **Unit Testing Plan** – For logic like `addProduct()`, `checkStock()`
- **Integration Testing Plan** – Simulate interaction between layers
- **UI Testing** – Via Figma prototype walkthroughs
- **Acceptance Criteria** – Mapped to use cases

---

##  Deliverables

- [x] UML Diagrams (PDF/PNG)
- [x] UI Wireframes (Figma)
- [x] Agile Planning Artifacts
- [x] System Architecture Document
- [x] README.md (this file)

---

##  Learning Outcomes

- Applied OOAD principles to real-world system modeling
- Designed modular, maintainable architecture for an inventory system
- Practiced Agile planning in a team-based environment
- Created user-focused UI wireframes with Figma
